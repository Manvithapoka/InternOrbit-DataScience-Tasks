# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Level 2 Task 2

This project is part of the **InternOrbit Data Science Internship (Level 2 – Task 2)**. It focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using various machine learning techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a classification model that accurately predicts passenger survival based on demographic and travel-related features from the Titanic dataset.

---

## 🧠 Workflow Overview

### 🗂️ Dataset:

- The dataset includes features such as:
  - `Pclass` – Ticket class
  - `Sex` – Gender
  - `Age`
  - `SibSp` – # of siblings/spouses aboard
  - `Parch` – # of parents/children aboard
  - `Fare`
  - `Embarked` – Port of embarkation
  - `Survived` – Target variable (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive)

---

### 🔍 Steps Performed:

- Handled missing data (e.g., imputing `Age`, `Embarked`)
- Converted categorical variables using encoding
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Built classification models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Results

- Successfully predicted survival of Titanic passengers.
- Compared multiple models to select the best-performing one.
- Gained insights into how features like gender, class, and fare influenced survival.
